            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's the start of a new year and we're excited to announce the release of reVISit v2.0 — just in time for your Vis 2025 submissions! We've been working hard to bring you a new and improved version of reVISit, and we can't wait for you to try it out.</p>
<p>There are a lot of new features in this release, so let's dive in and take a look at what's new:</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="new-features">New Features<a href="https://revisit.dev/blog/2025/01/20/release-2.0/#new-features" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to New Features" title="Direct link to New Features">​</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vega and Vega-Lite Support</strong>: We've added compatibility for Vega and Vega-Lite visualizations, so you can now include these types of visualizations in your studies, leveraging the power of the reVISit platform. This opens up a whole new world of possibilities for the types of studies you can create.</li>
<li><strong>Think-aloud Protocol</strong>: We've added support for the think-aloud protocol, so you can now capture participants' verbalizations as they interact with your study. This is a great way to gain insight into participants' thought processes and decision-making strategies and represents our latest effort to support qualitative research in reVISit. (TODO: LINK TO ZACH'S PAPER)</li>
<li><strong>Participant Replay</strong>: We've enabled participant replays, so you can now replay the interactions of participants in your studies during analysis. This is a great way to see how participants are interacting with your study.</li>
<li><strong>Libraries</strong>: We've added support for libraries, so you can now leverage prebuilt study components to create your own studies. Libraries are a great way to save time and effort when creating studies, as you can reuse components that have already been created by others. You can also share your own components with the community by creating your own library and submitting a pull request.</li>
<li><strong>reVISit-py</strong>: We've added a new Python package, <code>reVISit-py</code>, that allows you to interact with reVISit programmatically. You can use it to generate study configurations and review your generated studies all from the comfort of your warmest jupyter notebook. Check out the [documentation](TODO: ADD LINK) to learn more about how to use it.</li>
<li><strong>Improved User Interface</strong>: We've redesigned the user interface to make it more intuitive and user-friendly. You'll find it much more pleasant to use, with a cleaner and more modern look.</li>

<p>You might have heard of <strong><a href="https://revisit.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reVISit</a></strong> before from <a href="https://vdl.sci.utah.edu/publications/2023_shortpaper_revisit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our paper</a>, or you might have <a href="https://revisit.dev/community/#community-activities" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seen a talk or participated in a meetup</a>. But as of today, we’re excited to give the community a chance to run your own studies with reVISit with our 1.0 release – and CHI is just around the corner!</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-revisit">What is reVISit?<a href="https://revisit.dev/blog/2024/06/20/release-1.0/#what-is-revisit" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is reVISit?" title="Direct link to What is reVISit?">​</a></h2>
<p>ReVISit is a software framework that enables you to <a href="https://revisit.dev/docs/getting-started/how-does-it-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">assemble experimental stimuli and survey questions into an online user study</a>.
One of the biggest time-saving features of ReVISit is a JSON grammar, the <strong>reVISit Spec</strong>, used to describe the setup of your study.
Stimuli are contained in components and can be either markdown, images, web pages, React components, or survey questions.
The figure at the top shows the relationship of the reVISit Spec, the components, and how they are then compiled into a study.</p>
<p>Due to the different types of components, you can use reVISit for a diverse set of studies, spanning simple surveys, image-based perceptual experiments, and experiments evaluating complex interactive visualizations.</p>
<p>ReVISit is designed to accommodate sophisticated stimuli and study designs. Suppose you want to <a href="https://revisit.dev/study/demo-cleveland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">replicate the seminal Cleveland and McGill study</a>. With reVISit you could implement a React-based set of visualizations (a bar chart, a stacked bar chart, a pie chart), and then pass parameters, such as the data, and the markers to highlight the marks, all via the study configuration.</p>
<p>Similarly, the reVISit spec enables designers to create <a href="https://revisit.dev/docs/designing-studies/study-sequences/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">controlled sequences</a> defining in which order participants see stimuli. reVISit supports fixed, random, and Latin square designs that can be nested at various levels. For example, the overall study sequence (intro, training, experiment, survey) could be fixed. In the experiment arm, two conditions could use a Latin-square design. Within each condition, the experiment could randomly draw a small number of stimuli from a large stimuli pool while interspersing attention checks at random points and adding breaks.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="assembling-and-deploying-your-study">Assembling and Deploying your Study<a href="https://revisit.dev/blog/2024/06/20/release-1.0/#assembling-and-deploying-your-study" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Assembling and Deploying your Study" title="Direct link to Assembling and Deploying your Study">​</a></h3>
<p>The components and your study configuration are then used to <a href="https://revisit.dev/docs/getting-started/your-first-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">assemble a web-based study</a>. You can first look at your study on your local browser, and if you want to share it deploy it to the web server of your choice. We <a href="https://revisit.dev/docs/data-and-deployment/deploying-to-static-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recommend and document deploying to GitHub pages</a>, but any web server you have access to will do.</p>
<p>You can then use the online version to direct participants to your study. You can use crowdsourcing platforms such as Prolific, Mechanical Turk or LabintheWild, or you can simply send a link to participants that you have recruited in other ways.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="data-collection">Data Collection<a href="https://revisit.dev/blog/2024/06/20/release-1.0/#data-collection" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Data Collection" title="Direct link to Data Collection">​</a></h3>
<p>A typical study will have response fields, such as a text field or a slider, to provide the response. Such form-based responses are tracked by reVISit by default and can be downloaded in either JSON or a tidy tabular format. Similarly, you can provide <a href="https://revisit.dev/docs/designing-studies/html-stimulus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">response data out of interactive stimuli</a>. For example, if a task is to click on a specific bar in a bar chart, you can log which bars were clicked. ReVISit tracks a diverse set of browser window events such as mouse moves, clicks, scrolls, resizes, which are time-stamped and can hence be used for basic log file analysis.</p>
<p>ReVISit also supports advanced provenance tracking based on <a href="https://apps.vdl.sci.utah.edu/trrack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trrack</a> a provenance tracking library  developed at our lab. If you instrument your study stimuli with trrack, you can recreate every state of your interface of every single participant! This can be incredibly useful to <a href="https://vdl.sci.utah.edu/publications/2021_chi_revisit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">understand nuances of user behavior</a>, as well as to help you debug your stimuli by exploring what went wrong in a particular session. In a future release, reVISit will also allow you to dynamically browse these events and fully “re-hydrate” all participants experiments.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="data-storage">Data Storage<a href="https://revisit.dev/blog/2024/06/20/release-1.0/#data-storage" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Data Storage" title="Direct link to Data Storage">​</a></h3>
<p>ReVISit is implemented as a (mostly) server-less application, meaning that you don’t have to run, secure, and maintain a server to use reVISit. The only exception to this is data storage, as obviously, the data of online participants has to be stored somewhere.</p>
<p>If you’re running a local study, you can get away without this – you can just download the data from your browser after a study is complete. For online studies, we use Google Firebase to store data.</p>
<p>Currently, <a href="https://revisit.dev/docs/data-and-deployment/firebase-setup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">setting up Firebase for a reVISit study</a> might be the most challenging part of working with reVISit. On the plus side, Firebase is a tried-and-true system where you have full control over your data. You even have options to choose the locale of your server so that you are compliant with your country's regulations on data storage.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="data-analysis">Data Analysis<a href="https://revisit.dev/blog/2024/06/20/release-1.0/#data-analysis" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Data Analysis" title="Direct link to Data Analysis">​</a></h3>
<p>ReVISit is not meant to replace your usual data analysis approaches. Instead, it aims to make it easy to export data in the formats you might use in R, Python, or your analysis platform of choice.</p>
<p>ReVISit, however, does provide a basic <a href="https://revisit.dev/docs/analysis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">analytics interface</a> that is most useful for monitoring the progress of your study. You can also use reVISit to identify participants that didn’t appropriately complete the study and reject them, which is most useful if you want to ensure that you have appropriate numbers of participants in your Latin square design.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-are-the-benefits-of-using-revisit">What are the Benefits of Using reVISit?<a href="https://revisit.dev/blog/2024/06/20/release-1.0/#what-are-the-benefits-of-using-revisit" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What are the Benefits of Using reVISit?" title="Direct link to What are the Benefits of Using reVISit?">​</a></h2>
<p>So, why would you use reVISit over other approaches to running your study, such as Qualtrics, Survey Monkey, or even a custom experiment interface?</p>
<p>First, <strong>reVISit is open source</strong> with all the benefits you have of using open source software: it’s free; you can extend it; you can contribute to improving it.</p>
<p>Second, the open source nature and our approach of forking reVISit for your own study and storing your data in your own Firebase means that <strong>you have full control over your study and the data</strong>. Once you have forked the study, it will remain accessible and unchanged for as long as you like.</p>
<p>Third, reVISit has dedicated modes for <strong>quickly navigating your study</strong>, and you can also turn off data collection. This is great for both, developing your study, but also sharing your study with reviewers and readers of your research. That means that readers can see <strong>exactly</strong> what your participants saw, and hence may trust your study more. They could also fork your study and run a <strong>replication of your study</strong> with minimal effort! You can check out an <a href="https://vdl.sci.utah.edu/viz-guardrails-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">example study and the associated results.</a></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="im-intrigued-but-can-i-trust-it-for-my-experiment">I’m Intrigued, but Can I Trust it for my Experiment?<a href="https://revisit.dev/blog/2024/06/20/release-1.0/#im-intrigued-but-can-i-trust-it-for-my-experiment" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to I’m Intrigued, but Can I Trust it for my Experiment?" title="Direct link to I’m Intrigued, but Can I Trust it for my Experiment?">​</a></h2>
<p>reVISit is new, and we know that it’s fraught to bet on a new project if you don’t know whether it actually works or whether it will be maintained down the line. But we hope we can convince you to trust us!</p>
<p>First, we currently have multiple years of funding to continue development of reVISit.
We’ve also ourselves run several successful studies, such as <a href="https://vdl.sci.utah.edu/viz-guardrails-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a study on guardrails against misinformation</a>. Finally, we are committed to help you out if you run into issues! Join our <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/revisit-nsf/shared_invite/zt-25mrh5ppi-6sDAL6HqcWJh_uvt2~~DMQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">slack team</a> to get low-friction help, or write to us at <a href="mailto:contact@revisit.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contact@revisit.dev</a>. We’re also happy to set up a meeting to answer any questions you may have; for example, to talk us through whether reVISit will work for your study design.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-can-i-learn-more-or-get-involved">How Can I Learn More or Get Involved?<a href="https://revisit.dev/blog/2024/06/20/release-1.0/#how-can-i-learn-more-or-get-involved" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How Can I Learn More or Get Involved?" title="Direct link to How Can I Learn More or Get Involved?">​</a></h2>
<p>We’re grateful to all the community members who have shared their study needs and helped to make ReVISit 1.0 a reality, and we’re looking forward to bringing the community exciting new features in the coming year. Future releases will include better debugging tools through study rehydration, a way to capture and code think-aloud data, and improved analysis capabilities. Depending on community feedback we're also interested in branching out to unconventional display devices (phones, AR/VR, etc.)</p>
