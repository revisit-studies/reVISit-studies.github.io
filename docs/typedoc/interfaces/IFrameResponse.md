# IFrameResponse

The IFrameResponse interface is used to define the properties of an iframe response.
IFrameResponses render as a list, that is connected to a WebsiteComponent. When data is sent from the WebsiteComponent, it is displayed in the list.

## Extends

- [`BaseResponse`](BaseResponse.md)
