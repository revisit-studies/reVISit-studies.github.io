# Stage Management

## Overview

Stage Management helps you organize participants into different parts of your study. It’s useful for studies that have multiple sections or happen over time. Using stages makes it easier to track, filter, and analyze participants based on where they are in the study.

## Getting Started

Go to the **Manage** tab under **Analysis** and open the **Stage Management** section.

:::note
All studies start with a **DEFAULT** stage, which cannot be removed. The default color is orange (`#F05A30`), but you can change it if you want.
:::

## Adding a New Stage

## Setting the Current Stage

The current stage determines where all new participants will be added. To set a stage as the current one, simply click the radio button next to the stage you want. Once selected, any participants added afterward will automatically be placed in this stage.

## Stage Filter in Participant View

Each participant’s stage is shown in the table, making it easy to see and group participants. You can filter by stage using the filter at the top and select one or more stages.
