# ReVISit Analysis Platform

ReVISit provides an analysis platform for researchers to analyze their data. 
This platform is designed to allow researchers to quickly monitor their experimental data without needing to download it or perform analysis elsewhere. 
The platform currently includes the [Dashboard](./study-card), a place to check experiments at a glance, and the [Partipant View](./partipant-view), where researchers can inspect each record in table format.
