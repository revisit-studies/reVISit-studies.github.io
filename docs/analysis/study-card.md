The participants' status shows:
- **Completed** - the number of participants who have completed the experiment
- **In-Progress** - the number of participants who started but have not completed the experiment
- **Rejected** - the number of participants who were rejected

The activity time range shows the start date of the study and the date the last participant finished.
