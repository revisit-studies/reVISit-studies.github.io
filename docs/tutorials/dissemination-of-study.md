<!-- 

*** All markdown processed by Docusaurus is processed as MDX. That means that instead of using HTML inline syntax, you must use JSX inline syntax (so something like <span style="background-color:red">Hello World!</span> would instead need to be written as <span style={{backgroundColor:'red'}}>Hello World!</span>) ***

Admonitions Syntax:

-- Admonitions is the basic way to have a "tip" or "info" panel appear in docusaurus. This is similar to the "info" and "warning" panels we had in the original site using custom css. Please use these admonitions where needed:

Syntax:

:::info
:::

(You can change 'info' to the following: 'note', 'warning', 'tip', or 'danger')
