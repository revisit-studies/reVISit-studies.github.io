# Getting Started

If you'd like to get started right out of the gates with a small tutorial, you can begin in the [installation section](installation) and then move on to the [tutorial where you'll create a simple questionnaire](your-first-study). If you'd rather read more about the inner workings of reVISit — specifically how the studies in reVISit are created, designed, and maintained — you can visit the [How Does It Work](how-does-it-work) section first.
