# Getting Started

If you'd like to get started right out of the gates with a small tutorial, you can begin in the [installation section](installation) and then move on to our [simple questionnaire tutorial](tutorial-questionnaire). If you'd rather read more about the inner workings of reVISit -- specifically how the studies in reVISit are created, designed, and maintained -- you can visit our 'How Does It Work' of the reVISit spec [here](how-does-it-work).
