This study explores the potential of visualization design to combat cherry-picking—a common tactic used to misrepresent data—by developing a design space of guardrails aimed at discouraging this practice. Through crowd-sourced experiments, the researchers evaluate the effectiveness of these guardrails.",https://osf.io/preprints/osf/4j9nr,https://vdl.sci.utah.edu/viz-guardrails-study/,1.0.0,https://github.com/visdesignlab/viz-guardrails-study,u1317463@gcloud.utah.edu,"Visual Encoding, Visualization Technique"

The first study showed participants a few interactive charts and had them answer questions about the data, and the second showed participants static visualizations with associated captions and asked them if they trusted the data.
