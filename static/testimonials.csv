10/1/2024 11:09:37,Max Lisnic,Visualization Guardrails: Designing Interventions Against Cherry-Picking in Interactive Data Explorers,"Maxim Lisnic, Zach Cutler, Marina Kogan, Alexander Lex",ACM CHI,"The rise of interactive time series exploration platforms has made it easier for the general public to visualize data related to public interest, while also facilitating the creation of misleading visualizations through cherry-picked data. This study explores the potential of visualization design to combat cherry-picking—a common tactic used to misrepresent data—by developing a design space of guardrails aimed at discouraging this practice. Through crowd-sourced experiments, the researchers evaluate the effectiveness of these guardrails.",https://vdl.sci.utah.edu/publications/2025_chi_guardrails/,https://vdl.sci.utah.edu/viz-guardrails-study/,1.0.0,https://github.com/visdesignlab/viz-guardrails-study,u1317463@gcloud.utah.edu,"Perception / Visual Encoding, Visualization Technique",Yes,2024
