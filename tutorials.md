reVISit lets you create interactive studies using a JSON grammar. You create your stimuli as images, (interactive) html pages, or react components, and reVISit allows you to build the interface around your stimulus. The workflow for studies includes: 

* eliciting consent from your participants.
* training
* practice runs,
* the trials you want to use for testing, and
* survey elements.
