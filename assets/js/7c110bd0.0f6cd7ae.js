Once you have created a spec and the stimuli, you can build your study and deploy it to the web. You can use stimuli that are images, (interactive) html pages, or react components.","sidebar":"docs"},"tutorials/deploying-to-static-website":{"id":"tutorials/deploying-to-static-website","title":"Deploying To a Static Website","description":"Deploying your study should be relatively simple.

Because of this, we set up a storage engine in order to store the data that is gathered from users as they move through the study. While you can test the program locally without any storage, you will need to set up some sort of storage in order to save study participant data. Our intention is that those who create the study have full control over the data that is generated by participants -- no data is ever linked back to the reVISit repository or those who have contributed to its creation. See the Deployment section for more information about deploying your study to GitHub.io once the connection to Firebase has been set up.","sidebar":"docs"},"typedoc/index":{"id":"typedoc/index","title":"Documentation","description":"To create a study with reVISit, you have to create components that contain the content of your study, and you have to create the study configuration (the reVISit Spec) that controls when and how these components are shown to participants.
