Our intention is that those who create the study have full control over the data that is generated by participants -- no data is ever linked back to the reVISit repository or those who have contributed to its creation.

Currently, we do not expose a baseComponents function. Instead, base components are still well-defined components and can be passed during the creation of another component. The final configuration will not include base components but will have the expected inherited
