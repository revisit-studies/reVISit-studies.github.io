Each of the examples takes advantage of the revisitpy-server and a Jupyter notebook environment.

Just like in the study configuration file, you can create components, responses, study metadata, UI config, and complex sequences. Then, you can combine these all together in a single study configuration file. Here is an example of creating a simple response and attaching it to a single component.","sidebar":"docs"},"revisitpy/installation":{"id":"revisitpy/installation","title":"Installation","description":"Adding reVISitPy to a python project is simple.

We expose a factory function for each top-level item in the reVISit configuration: studyMetadata, uiConfig, components, sequence, and studyMetadata. Currently, we do not expose a baseComponents function. Instead, base components are still well-defined components and can be passed during the creation of another component. The final configuration will not include base components but will have the expected inherited output.","sidebar":"docs"},"typedoc/globals":{"id":"typedoc/globals","title":"Modules","description":"Interfaces"},"typedoc/index":{"id":"typedoc/index","title":"Reference
