# Study Summary

The study summary gives users a quick overview of their study at a glance. It provides a comprehensive overview of their study data in a single, easy-to-understand dashboard.

The summary is organized into three main sections: Overview Statistics, Component Statistics, and Response Statistics. At the top, participant filters allow you to filter the analysis by including or excluding completed, in-progress, or rejected participants.
