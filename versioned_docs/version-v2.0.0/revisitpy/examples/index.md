# Examples

Here you'll find several examples for designing full studies using reVISitPy. You can find each of these examples in the [reVISitPy examples repository](https://github.com/revisit-studies/revisit-py-examples) as well.

Each of the examples takes advantage of the `revisitpy_server` and a Jupyter notebook environment. While neither of these are necessary to create complex configuration files, they are the quickest ways to get started with reVISitPy and the best way to create a closed-feedback loop for quick iterations of your study design.
