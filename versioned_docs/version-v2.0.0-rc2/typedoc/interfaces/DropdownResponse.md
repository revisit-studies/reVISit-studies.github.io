# DropdownResponse

The DropdownResponse interface is used to define the properties of a dropdown response.
DropdownResponses render as a select input with user specified options.

Example:
```js
{
 "id": "q-color",
 "prompt": "What is your favorite color?",
 "location": "aboveStimulus",
 "type": "dropdown",
 "placeholder": "Please choose your favorite color",
 "options": ["Red", "Blue"]
}
 ```
