# TypeDoc

In this section, you can find detailed documentation for all of the interfaces and types used in the reVISit application. This will help you understand the ins-and-outs of each of the major components of a reVISit study. Before delving into this technical documentation, we suggest that you already have reVISit installed, working locally, and that you have already read our detailed information about the reVISit study configurations in the ['How Does It Work?'](../getting-started/how-does-it-work) section.
