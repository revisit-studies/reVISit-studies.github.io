# Setting Up Authentication

## Enabling Authentication

Through the navigation panel on the right of your reVISit application, navigate to the "settings" page. Here, you will see that authentication will be currently disabled with a button to enable authentication.

When you first enable authentication, you will be prompted to sign in using Google SSO. The account chosen will automatically be added as a user. Any other account attempting to log in to reVISit and access these protected routes will be redirected to the login screen. 

## Adding Additional Users

To add another administrator, simply navigate to the settings page (where you enabled authentication) and click on the 'Add User' icon to the right of the "Enable Users" section. Enter the Google account email for the user and click save. They will now be an administrator and will immediately be able to log into your reVISit application

## Removing A User

In the "Enabled Users" section, you will see the "delete" icon to the right of each user aside from yourself. Any administrator is capable of deleting any user from the reVISit system. The only restriction is that you cannot delete yourself and there can never be less than one user.
