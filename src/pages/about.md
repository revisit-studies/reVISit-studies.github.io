# What is reVISit? 

The reVISit project addresses a critical bottleneck in visualization research: how can we better and more efficiently empirically evaluate visualization techniques? ReVISit aims to democratize evaluation of interactive visualization techniques, an area that has been under-explored, due in part to the high technical burden and skills required to create complex online experiments. 

The key innovations of this project are: 

1. **Flexible study creation** based on a domain-specific language, the reVISit Spec.
2. **Simple data collection** — out of the box for standard response types, but with the ability to track detailed events based on provenance-enabled stimuli.
3. **Simple data storage** — no need to run your own servers: data is stored in a relatively easy to set-up Firebase instance. 
4. **Open source and free** – share your study design with anyone, no license required. 
5. **Compatible with crowdsourcing platforms** — recruit your participants through your preferred provide, such as Prolific, Mechanical Turk, or Lab in the Wild. 
6. **Keep track of study progress** — see how participants are doing and identify issues with your study quickly. 
7. **Export your data** — in a format suitable for your analysis. 

## Demo 

You can check out a few example projects on our [demo page](https://revisit.dev/study/). All of the demos on this site are build from stimuli and examples that you can find in the [github repo](https://github.com/revisit-studies/study).

Check out the [getting started tutorial](../docs/introduction/) to learn how to build your own experiment.
